"""
This program reads BAM files and counts the number of reads that match
the alternate and reference allele at every SNP position in the provided
SNP HDF5 data files. The read counts are stored in specified HDF5 output
files.

Additionally counts of all reads are stored in another track (at the
left-most position of the reads).

This program does not perform filtering of reads based on mappability.
It is assumed that the inpute BAM files are filtered appropriately prior to
calling this script.

Reads that overlap known indels are not included in allele-specific
counts.


usage: bam2h5.py OPTIONS BAM_FILE1 [BAM_FILE2 ...]

BAM Files:
     Aligned reads are read from one or more BAM files. The provided
     BAM files must be sorted and indexed.

Input Options:
     --chrom CHROM_TXT_FILE [required]
	   Path to chromInfo.txt file (may be gzipped) with list of
	   chromosomes for the relevant genome assembly. Each line
	   in file should contain tab-separated chromosome name and
	   chromosome length (in basepairs). chromInfo.txt files can
	   be downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. For example,
	   a chromInfo.txt.gz file for hg19 can be downloaded from
	   http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/

     --snp_index SNP_INDEX_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file containing SNP index. The SNP index is
       used to convert the genomic position of a SNP to its
       corresponding row in the haplotype and snp_tab
       HDF5 files.

     --snp_tab SNP_TABLE_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file to read SNP information from. Each row of SNP
       table contains SNP name (rs_id), position, allele1, allele2.

     --haplotype HAPLOTYPE_H5_FILE [optional]
       Path to HDF5 file to read phased haplotypes from.
       If supplied, when read overlaps multiple SNPs counts are randomly
       assigned to ONE of the overlapping HETEROZYGOUS SNPs; if not supplied
       counts are randomly assigned to ONE of overlapping SNPs (regardless of
       their genotype).

     --samples SAMPLES_TXT_FILE [optional]
       Path to text file containing a list of individual identifiers. The
       ordering of individuals must be consistent with the haplotype
       file. The samples file is assumed to have one identifier per line
       in the first column (other columns are ignored).

     --individual INDIVIDUAL [optional]
       Identifier for individual, used to determine which
       SNPs are heterozygous. Must be provided
       if --haplotype argument is provided and must match one of the
       individuals in the file provided with --samples argument.

Output Options:
     --data_type uint8|uint16
       Data type of stored counts; uint8 takes up less disk
       space but has a maximum value of 255 (default=uint8).

     --ref_as_counts REF_AS_COUNT_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file to write counts of reads that match reference allele.
       Allele-specific counts are stored at the position of the SNP.

     --alt_as_counts ALT_AS_COUNT_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file to write counts of reads that match alternate allele.
       Allele-specific counts are stored at the position of the SNP.

     --other_as_counts OTHER_AS_COUNT_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file to write counts of reads that match neither reference
       nor alternate allele. Allele-specific counts are stored at the position
       of the SNP.

     --read_counts READ_COUNT_H5_FILE [required]
       Path to HDF5 file to write counts of all reads, regardless of whether
       they overlap a SNP. Read counts are stored at the left-most position
       of the mapped read.
